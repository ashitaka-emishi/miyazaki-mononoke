# Structures in Princess Mononoke

## Prologue

### Text

> *In ancient times,
the land lay covered in forests,
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.
Back then, man and beast
lived in harmony,
but as time went by, most
of the great forests were destroyed.
Those that remained were guarded
by gigantic beasts...
who owed their allegiance
to the Great Forest Spirit,
for those were the days
of gods and demons.*

#### Comments
The prologue is voiced by Keith David in an aesthetic of a wise elder narrator similar to narration and voice over from Morgan Freeman.

Keith David also plays Otoko, the blind white boar who arrives later in the movie to make a last stand defending the forest in hopes of redeeming his brother Nago "I am ashamed on as Najo has come from out tribe."
 
This is a result of Moro's commentary "Nago was afraid to die.  He fled and the darkness overcame him.  I too carry the poisoned human bullet within my breast.  I remain and contemplate my fate."

**Question**:
>  _Is this progression of the gods acceptance of death bring them back into unity with man?_


### Timeline

Time flows from ages long ago to in ancient times to present (Muramachi era)

| age | object           | action    | subject             | active/passive |
|-----|------------------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| AT  | great forests    | covered   | land                | P              |
| AAT | spirits of gods  | dwelt     | great forests       | A              |
| AAT | man              | coexist   | beasts              | A & P **       |
| P   | discord          | destroyed | great forests       | P              |
| P   | giant beasts     | guard     | great forests       | P              |
| p   | giant beasts     | serve     | great forest spirit | P              |
| p   | gods and demons  | ruled     | land                | A              |

Over time, Man leaving the forest leads to:
* great forests are destroyed being dispersed into the Great Forest Spirit
* the spirits of the gods coalesce and become giant beasts that owe obediance to the GFS and guard the great forests (from being destroyed)
* the harmony between man and beast split into gods the conflict between demons
